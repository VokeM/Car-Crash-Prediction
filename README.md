# Car-Crash-Prediction
Nigeria as one of the countries with the highest rate of accidents. Accidents cause significant losses to present and future productive manpower of our country, as well as, in many cases, profound social problems, deaths or serious injury. Hence this project was carried out to be   able to predict car crashes based on the driver's behavioural patterns, in this case, using the age of the driver.
The Car Crash Prediction System (Using the Driver’s Behavioural Factors) was created using three different algorithms to predict crashes before they occur so as to save lives and properties. The three algorithms used are the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, the Stacked Auto-Encoder (SAE) algorithm and an ensemble of both the SAE and LSTM (LSTM-SAE) algorithms. The data used for this project was gotten from kaggle.com and vincentarelbundock.github.io. The dataset has a data size of 8,020 after cleaning. After training, the LSTM had an accuracy value of 98.6%, the SAE had an accuracy value of 76.4%, and the LSTM-SAE had an accuracy value of 81.4%, showing that the ensemble model was a combination of the performance of both models. Future studies of car crashes and how drivers’ behaviour affects it are needed to explore more variable that may cause accidents.
